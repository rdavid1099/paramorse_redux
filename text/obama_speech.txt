Mr President and Mrs Bush my friend the Vice President and Dr Biden Mayor Rawlings Chief Spiller clergy members of Congress Chief Brown Im so glad I met Michelle first because she loves Stevie Wonder laughter and applause but most of all to the families and friends and colleagues and fellow officers Scripture tells us that in our sufferings there is glory because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope Sometimes the truths of these words are hard to see Right now those words test us Because the people of Dallas people across the country are suffering Were here to honor the memory and mourn the loss of five fellow Americans to grieve with their loved ones to support this community to pray for the wounded and to try and find some meaning amidst our sorrow For the men and women who protect and serve the people of Dallas last Thursday began like any other day Like most Americans each day you get up probably have too quick a breakfast kiss your family goodbye and you head to work But your work and the work of police officers across the country is like no other For the moment you put on that uniform you have answered a call that at any moment even in the briefest interaction may put your life in harms way Lorne Ahrens he answered that call So did his wife Katrina not only because she was the spouse of a police officer but because shes a detective on the force They have two kids And Lorne took them fishing and used to proudly go to their school in uniform And the night before he died he bought dinner for a homeless man And the next night Katrina had to tell their children that their dad was gone They dont get it yet their grandma said They dont know what to do quite yet Michael Krol answered that call His mother said He knew the dangers of the job but he never shied away from his duty He came a thousand miles from his home state of Michigan to be a cop in Dallas telling his family This is something I wanted to do Last year he brought his girlfriend back to Detroit for Thanksgiving and it was the last time hed see his family Michael Smith answered that call in the Army and over almost 30 years working for the Dallas Police Association which gave him the appropriately named Cops Cop award A man of deep faith when he was off duty he could be found at church or playing softball with his two girls Today his girls have lost their dad for God has called Michael home Patrick Zamarripa he answered that call Just 32 a former altar boy who served in the Navy and dreamed of being a cop He liked to post videos of himself and his kids on social media And on Thursday night while Patrick went to work his partner Kristy posted a photo of her and their daughter at a Texas Rangers game and tagged her partner so that he could see it while on duty Brent Thompson answered that call He served his country as a Marine And years later as a contractor he spent time in some of the most dangerous parts of Iraq and Afghanistan And then a few years ago he settled down here in Dallas for a new life of service as a transit cop And just about two weeks ago he married a fellow officer their whole life together waiting before them Like police officers across the country these men and their families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves They werent looking for their names to be up in lights Theyd tell you the pay was decent but wouldnt make you rich They could have told you about the stress and long shifts and theyd probably agree with Chief Brown when he said that cops dont expect to hear the words thank you very often especially from those who need them the most No the reward comes in knowing that our entire way of life in America depends on the rule of law that the maintenance of that law is a hard and daily labor that in this country we dont have soldiers in the streets or militias setting the rules Instead we have public servants police officers like the men who were taken away from us And thats what these five were doing last Thursday when they were assigned to protect and keep orderly a peaceful protest in response to the killing of Alton Sterling of Baton Rouge and Philando Castile of Minnesota They were upholding the constitutional rights of this country For a while the protest went on without incident And despite the fact that police conduct was the subject of the protest despite the fact that there must have been signs or slogans or chants with which they profoundly disagreed these men and this department did their jobs like the professionals that they were In fact the police had been part of the protests planning Dallas PD even posted photos on their Twitter feeds of their own officers standing among the protesters Two officers black and white smiled next to a man with a sign that read No Justice No Peace And then around nine oclock the gunfire came Another community torn apart More hearts broken More questions about what caused and what might prevent another such tragedy I know that Americans are struggling right now with what weve witnessed over the past week First the shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge and the protests then the targeting of police by the shooter here an act not just of demented violence but of racial hatred All of it has left us wounded and angry and hurt Its as if the deepest fault lines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed perhaps even widened And although we know that such divisions are not new though they have surely been worse in even the recent past that offers us little comfort Faced with this violence we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged We wonder if an AfricanAmerican community that feels unfairly targeted by police and police departments that feel unfairly maligned for doing their jobs can ever understand each others experience We turn on the TV or surf the Internet and we can watch positions harden and lines drawn and people retreat to their respective corners and politicians calculate how to grab attention or avoid the fallout We see all this and its hard not to think sometimes that the center wont hold and that things might get worse I understand I understand how Americans are feeling But Dallas Im here to say we must reject such despair Im here to insist that we are not as divided as we seem And I know that because I know America I know how far weve come against impossible odds Applause I know well make it because of what Ive experienced in my own life what Ive seen of this country and its people their goodness and decency as President of the United States And I know it because of what weve seen here in Dallas how all of you out of great suffering have shown us the meaning of perseverance and character and hope When the bullets started flying the men and women of the Dallas police they did not flinch and they did not react recklessly They showed incredible restraint Helped in some cases by protesters they evacuated the injured isolated the shooter and saved more lives than we will ever know Applause We mourn fewer people today because of your brave actions Applause Everyone was helping each other one witness said It wasnt about black or white Everyone was picking each other up and moving them away See thats the America I know The police helped Shetamia Taylor as she was shot trying to shield her four sons She said she wanted her boys to join her to protest the incidents of black men being killed She also said to the Dallas PD Thank you for being heroes And today her 12yearold son wants to be a cop when he grows up Thats the America I know Applause In the aftermath of the shooting weve seen Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown a white man and a black man with different backgrounds working not just to restore order and support a shaken city a shaken department but working together to unify a city with strength and grace and wisdom Applause And in the process weve been reminded that the Dallas Police Department has been at the forefront of improving relations between police and the community Applause The murder rate here has fallen Complaints of excessive force have been cut by 64 percent The Dallas Police Department has been doing it the right way Applause And so Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown on behalf of the American people thank you for your steady leadership thank you for your powerful example We could not be prouder of you Applause These men this department this is the America I know And today in this audience I see people who have protested on behalf of criminal justice reform grieving alongside police officers I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost but also weep for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile In this audience I see whats possible applause I see whats possible when we recognize that we are one American family all deserving of equal treatment all deserving of equal respect all children of God Thats the America that I know Now Im not nave I have spoken at too many memorials during the course of this presidency Ive hugged too many families who have lost a loved one to senseless violence And Ive seen how a spirit of unity born of tragedy can gradually dissipate overtaken by the return to business as usual by inertia and old habits and expediency I see how easily we slip back into our old notions because theyre comfortable were used to them Ive seen how inadequate words can be in bringing about lasting change Ive seen how inadequate my own words have been And so Im reminded of a passage in Johns Gospel First John Let us love not with words or speech but with actions and in truth If were to sustain the unity we need to get through these difficult times if we are to honor these five outstanding officers who weve lost then we will need to act on the truths that we know And thats not easy It makes us uncomfortable But were going to have to be honest with each other and ourselves We know that the overwhelming majority of police officers do an incredibly hard and dangerous job fairly and professionally They are deserving of our respect and not our scorn Applause And when anyone no matter how good their intentions may be paints all police as biased or bigoted we undermine those officers we depend on for our safety And as for those who use rhetoric suggesting harm to police even if they dont act on it themselves well they not only make the jobs of police officers even more dangerous but they do a disservice to the very cause of justice that they claim to promote Applause We also know that centuries of racial discrimination of slavery and subjugation and Jim Crow they didnt simply vanish with the end of lawful segregation They didnt just stop when Dr King made a speech or the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act were signed Race relations have improved dramatically in my lifetime Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggles that helped us achieve that progress Applause But we know but America we know that bias remains We know it Whether you are black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or of Middle Eastern descent we have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point Weve heard it at times in our own homes If were honest perhaps weve heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts We know that And while some suffer far more under racisms burden some feel to a far greater extent discriminations sting Although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children better none of us is entirely innocent No institution is entirely immune And that includes our police departments We know this And so when African Americans from all walks of life from different communities across the country voice a growing despair over what they perceive to be unequal treatment when study after study shows that whites and people of color experience the criminal justice system differently so that if youre black youre more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested more likely to get longer sentences more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime when mothers and fathers raise their kids right and have the talk about how to respond if stopped by a police officer yes sir no sir but still fear that something terrible may happen when their child walks out the door still fear that kids being stupid and not quite doing things right might end in tragedy when all this takes place more than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid Applause We cant simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism To have your experience denied like that dismissed by those in authority dismissed perhaps even by your white friends and coworkers and fellow church members again and again and again it hurts Surely we can see that all of us We also know what Chief Brown has said is true That so much of the tensions between police departments and minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves Applause As a society we choose to underinvest in decent schools We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment Applause We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs Applause We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book applause and then we tell the police youre a social worker youre the parent youre the teacher youre the drug counselor We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience Dont make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind And then we feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over We know these things to be true Theyve been true for a long time We know it Police you know it Protestors you know it You know how dangerous some of the communities where these police officers serve are and you pretend as if theres no context These things we know to be true And if we cannot even talk about these things if we cannot talk honestly and openly not just in the comfort of our own circles but with those who look different than us or bring a different perspective then we will never break this dangerous cycle In the end its not about finding policies that work its about forging consensus and fighting cynicism and finding the will to make change Can we do this Can we find the character as Americans to open our hearts to each other Can we see in each other a common humanity and a shared dignity and recognize how our different experiences have shaped us And it doesnt make anybody perfectly good or perfectly bad it just makes us human I dont know I confess that sometimes I too experience doubt Ive been to too many of these things Ive seen too many families go through this But then I am reminded of what the Lord tells Ezekiel I will give you a new heart the Lord says and put a new spirit in you I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh Thats what we must pray for each of us a new heart Not a heart of stone but a heart open to the fears and hopes and challenges of our fellow citizens Thats what weve seen in Dallas these past few days Thats what we must sustain Because with an open heart we can learn to stand in each others shoes and look at the world through each others eyes so that maybe the police officer sees his own son in that teenager with a hoodie whos kind of goofing off but not dangerous applause and the teenager maybe the teenager will see in the police officer the same words and values and authority of his parents Applause With an open heart we can abandon the overheated rhetoric and the oversimplification that reduces whole categories of our fellow Americans not just to opponents but to enemies With an open heart those protesting for change will guard against reckless language going forward look at the model set by the five officers we mourn today acknowledge the progress brought about by the sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas and embark on the hard but necessary work of negotiation the pursuit of reconciliation With an open heart police departments will acknowledge that just like the rest of us they are not perfect that insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not an attack on cops but an effort to live up to our highest ideals Applause And I understand these protests I see them they can be messy Sometimes they can be hijacked by an irresponsible few Police can get hurt Protestors can get hurt They can be frustrating But even those who dislike the phrase Black Lives Matter surely we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterlings family Applause We should when we hear a friend describe him by saying that Whatever he cooked he cooked enough for everybody that should sound familiar to us that maybe he wasnt so different than us so that we can yes insist that his life matters Just as we should hear the students and coworkers describe their affection for Philando Castile as a gentle soul Mr Rogers with dreadlocks they called him and know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all races of all ages and that we have to do what we can without putting officers lives at risk but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost With an open heart we can worry less about which side has been wronged and worry more about joining sides to do right Applause Because the vicious killer of these police officers they wont be the last person who tries to make us turn on one other The killer in Orlando wasnt nor was the killer in Charleston We know there is evil in this world Thats why we need police departments Applause But as Americans we can decide that people like this killer will ultimately fail They will not drive us apart We can decide to come together and make our country reflect the good inside us the hopes and simple dreams we share We also glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope For all of us life presents challenges and suffering accidents illnesses the loss of loved ones There are times when we are overwhelmed by sudden calamity natural or manmade All of us we make mistakes And at times we are lost And as we get older we learn we dont always have control of things not even a President does But we do have control over how we respond to the world We do have control over how we treat one another America does not ask us to be perfect Precisely because of our individual imperfections our founders gave us institutions to guard against tyranny and ensure no one is above the law a democracy that gives us the space to work through our differences and debate them peacefully to make things better even if it doesnt always happen as fast as wed like America gives us the capacity to change But as the men we mourn today these five heroes knew better than most we cannot take the blessings of this nation for granted Only by working together can we preserve those institutions of family and community rights and responsibilities law and selfgovernment that is the hallmark of this nation For it turns out we do not persevere alone Our character is not found in isolation Hope does not arise by putting our fellow man down it is found by lifting others up Applause And thats what I take away from the lives of these outstanding men The pain we feel may not soon pass but my faith tells me that they did not die in vain I believe our sorrow can make us a better country I believe our righteous anger can be transformed into more justice and more peace Weeping may endure for a night but Im convinced joy comes in the morning Applause We cannot match the sacrifices made by Officers Zamarripa and Ahrens Krol Smith and Thompson but surely we can try to match their sense of service We cannot match their courage but we can strive to match their devotion May God bless their memory May God bless this country that we love
